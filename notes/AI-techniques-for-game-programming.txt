zchromosomes are bit strings
  encode to be a gene.
  how to encode genes?? big question

define the crossover rate, mut rate, pop size, chromie length
population is 2x the chromie len 

each gen

epoch
  test each pop member
  eval fitness
  create new pop
    select 2 chromies, based on fitness
    use crossover and mutation rates to create 2 offspring

crossover
  rate = 0.7. can change
  if rand <0.7 choose a random index to cross over at
  return 2 chromies

mutate
  rate = 0.001
  for floats: 0.1 
  go over each chromie's bits to alter


elitism, guarantee X num of agents are in the new generation

pathfinding
  series of instructions are the chromies 


when u need valid chromosomes:
partially mapped crossover
  2 crossover points, map the numbers between and swap those instances
exchange mutation
  swap 2 nums in a chromie 



// DIFFERENT METHODS (PG 194)

many different selection methods
  elitism
    keep a small percentage. 2-5%
    good idea to have some elitism 
  keep in mind:
    converging too quickly might not get the solution
  keep different functions on hand

  SteadyStateSelection(SSS)
    remove X worst performers
    continues as normal
    not advised
  StochasticUniversalSampling(SUS)
    *
    good for when u do roulette wheel in a small population 

  
we can set threshold as a weight 
  just add -threshold to the activation equation
  make sure u dont pass it in to the next layer

  this way, threshold evolves with the weights
