zchromosomes are bit strings
  encode to be a gene.
  how to encode genes?? big question

define the crossover rate, mut rate, pop size, chromie length
population is 2x the chromie len 

each gen

epoch
  test each pop member
  eval fitness
  create new pop
    select 2 chromies, based on fitness
    use crossover and mutation rates to create 2 offspring

crossover
  rate = 0.7. can change
  if rand <0.7 choose a random index to cross over at
  return 2 chromies

mutate
  rate = 0.001
  go over each chromie's bits to alter


elitism, guarantee X num of agents are in the new generation

pathfinding
  series of instructions are the chromies 


when u need valid chromosomes:
partially mapped crossover
  2 crossover points, map the numbers between and swap those instances
exchange mutation
  swap 2 nums in a chromie
